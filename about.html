      <p>
        Pattern Zero is a collection of behavioral and psychological patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each pattern is designed to highlight a recurring way people think, decide, or avoid — especially in situations where self-perception and actual behavior quietly diverge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site does not diagnose, label, or evaluate people.<br>
It does not provide advice, prescriptions, or solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The patterns here are observational.<br>
They exist to surface blind spots, not to fix them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a pattern resonates, that doesn’t mean it is “true.”<br>
If it doesn’t, that doesn’t mean it is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patterns are mirrors — not verdicts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pattern Zero was built for people who are curious about <italic>how they move through the world,</italic> not for people looking to be told what to do.
